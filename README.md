Architecture Overview

 - Use Google Forms to populate a Google Docs Spreadsheet which serves as a backend for the static HTML of the website


Installing JavaScript Libraries (only use when updating libraries)

- Install "bower"
- "bower install jquery-sheetrock"
- "bower install mapbox.js"
- "bower install bootstrap"
- add necessary libraries and css to head of file


The Map Itself

- the underlying map tiles and style come from Mapbox (not the data points themselves)
- data points are being grabbed from a google doc spreadsheet
